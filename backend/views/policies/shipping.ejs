      <p>Welcome to the RazorPay Demo Shipping Policy. This page outlines our shipping practices for premium services.</p>
      <p>Currently, our premium services are digital and do not involve physical shipping. All access is provided instantly upon payment via your account dashboard.</p>
      <p>Digital premium access is activated within minutes of a successful payment. No physical delivery timelines apply.</p>
      <p>There are no shipping fees as our premium offerings are entirely digital.</p>
